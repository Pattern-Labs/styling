# General Styling for Pattern Tools

This repo is just for general styling we might need, intended for web-based uis, but general styling can go in here as well.  

Use [jsdeliver](https://www.jsdelivr.com/?docs=gh) to get styling for web based ui's 

For all other UI's you can clone the repo as a submodule.

# TODO
- [ ] at some point once we reach a more stable dev, we should make this work of releases/restricted main, instead of free flow edits whatever is pushed to main. (for now this is fine)
